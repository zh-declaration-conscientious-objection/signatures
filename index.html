  <h1>University Staff, Faculty, and Research Students in Zurich Commit to the Zurich Declaration of Conscientious Objection</h1>
  <p>As signatories of this pledge, we form a collective of staff, research students, and associations at the University of Zurich, ETH Zurich, Empa, Eawag, PSI, ZHdK, ZHAW, and other institutions of higher education and research in Zurich, who individually, but within our responsibilities as members of the academic sphere, commit to the actions outlined below. We are motivated out of international solidarity to end Israel’s regime of occupation, settler colonialism, apartheid, and now genocide in Gaza (1–5), as well as numerous statements from ETH Zurich placing emphasis on individual academic freedom in making decisions on research collaborations and relationships.  
As members of the academic community, we see a particular need to speak out and act in solidarity with our colleagues in Gaza, who are victims of what has widely been described as a “scholasticide” (6). In the year following October 2023, at least 117 university staff members and 681 university students were killed by Israeli forces in Gaza (7), and all 12 universities in Gaza were damaged or destroyed (8), along with 90% of school buildings (9), cultural centres, archives, libraries, and museums (10). The situation in Gaza has deteriorated since October 2024, leading to a catastrophic health emergency (2) and widespread famine as confirmed by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) (11). The United Nations Human Rights Council and the International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS) have declared that Israel’s policies and actions meet the legal definition of genocide (4,5), and the Israeli government has openly announced its plans to illegally annex the West Bank (12) and launched a ground invasion into Gaza city despite international condemnation (13). 
The catastrophic consequences of Israel’s disregard for human rights - not only in their genocidal war against Gaza, but also in maintaining an apartheid state (14) demands institutional and individual action. As legal observers - including 31 law professors in Switzerland (15) - have made clear, public institutions around the world, including universities, have a duty to respond to Israel’s actions to avoid institutional complicity (1,5). Inaction at this critical juncture only serves to accelerate the systematic dismantling of international structures established to guarantee human rights following the evils of two World Wars and the Holocaust.
The complicity of Israeli academic institutions in the violation of Palestinian human rights has been extensively documented (1,16,17). Institutions such as the Weizmann Institute, Technion University, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and the University of Haifa are embedded within the Israeli military-industrial complex, developing military technologies and surveillance infrastructure central to the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, as well as hosting their military academies and educating the Israeli officer class. Israeli universities also develop the moral, academic, and legal frameworks to rationalise or deny Israeli crimes against Palestinians (18) while systematically discriminating against Palestinian students and staff and actively participating in the illegal occupation of Palestinian lands (16,19). 
A list of academic institutions and their  role in the violation of Palestinian rights is provided in Table 1. In view of their structural ties with the Israel military, Table 1 highlights the importance of immediately halting any material support provided by researchers in Switzerland to these institutions:
